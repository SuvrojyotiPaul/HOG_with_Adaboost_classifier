# HOG_with_Adaboost_classifier


## Project Overview

This project focuses on the implementation of the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG) technique, a fundamental feature extraction method used in computer vision, particularly for object detection. It also explores the

integration of HoG with the AdaBoost Classifier, a powerful machine learning algorithm for classification tasks.

### Key Features

#### Task 1: Creating Histogram of Oriented Gradients

- **Get Oriented Gradients Function (`get_oriented_gradients`)**: 
  - **Purpose**: To compute the gradient magnitudes and directions in an image.
  - **Implementation**: This function calculates the gradients at each pixel and their orientations, which are crucial for understanding the structure within the image.

- **HoG Features Function (`hog_features`)**: 
  - **Purpose**: To create a histogram of oriented gradients from the output of `get_oriented_gradients`.
  - **Implementation**: This function aggregates the gradient information over various image regions, compiling it into a comprehensive descriptor - the HoG feature vector.

#### Task 2: Using HoG with AdaBoost Classifier

- **Integration with AdaBoost**: 
  - **Objective**: To utilize the HoG features within the AdaBoost Classifier framework.
  - **Application**: This combination is particularly effective in scenarios like object detection and image classification, where robust feature representation is key.
